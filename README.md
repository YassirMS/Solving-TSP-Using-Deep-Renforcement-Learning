# Solving-TSP-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Traveling Salesman's Problem is a well know Operational Reasearch Problem, that is NP-hard. Multiple exact solvers exist such as CORODE [Reference]. 
Recently, Deep Renforcement learning methods are gaining more momentum, such as l2i[ref] or l2gls[ref] becasue of their capacity to solve such problems in very much lower time. 
# Additional Value of this project
In this project, we will do an implementation of the l2i, l2gls methods and try to improve the solutions through a comparative approach.
